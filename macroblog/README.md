## Run project with this

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
It will open http://localhost:3000 in the browser.


### Deployment Stuff if I ever want to play around

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
