# BlogSite

Blog site using React and MaterialUI on the front end. Backend using Expressjs and Postgresql. App is currently not deployed but there are pictures in the screenshot folder. Started this project awhile ago and wanted to come back to it and add style and some more meat to it which is what I did.

TODO's: Fix theme issue, make pictures available to add to a post
